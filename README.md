# Link-State-Routing-Algorithm

This project is to simulate link-state routing algorithm.
Program requires input file containing network information from user and print the connection table of inputted source router. 
Dijkstra’ algorithm is applied to print the shortest path along with cost between the source and destination. 
Program also allows user to put down/remove an inputted router and print the new shortest path between source and destination along with the cost. 
It also helps to find the best router which has shortest path to all other routers in the network.

Project consists of following files:
1. Project_Presentation.ppt - This file contains the presentation of the project.
2. Project_Manual.pdf - This file contains the project operation manual.
3. linkstate.c - This file contains the source code of the project.
4. linkstate - This is the executable file of the linkstate.c
5. 6routers.txt, 7routers.txt, 10routers.txt – These file are sample test input files which can be used as input for the program.
